# Regression
The regression portion of this repository is further subdivided into neural network approaches (`deep_learning`
directory) and support vector and random forest regression approaches (`svr_and_rfr` directory). Each of these
directories contain a README which specifies how to train and evaluate models. The data files referenced in the data 
config files can be found in `data` folder, with the exception of 
`lbled_o1_selected.csv` which must be generated (as described in the README in `deep_learning` and `svr_and_rfr` 
directories).
