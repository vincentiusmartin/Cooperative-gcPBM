## Random Forest Regression and Supprt Vector Regression for the prediction of cooperativity
Predicting transcription factor cooperativity from DNA sequences

### Overview
Within the study of gene regulation, there is an insufficient understanding of cooperative binding
of transcription factors (TFs). Based on results from genomic-context protein binding microarray 
(gc-PBM, or just PBM) data, we trained models to quantitatively predict the binding level of a
given DNA sequences. The repository contains attempts to accomplish this regression task via two 
classical machine learning approaches: Random Forest Regression and Support Vector Regression.

### Random Forest Regression

### Support Vector Regression

### Cross-Validation and Hyper-parameter search

### Further Reading
Refer to the dl_cooperativity repository, which contains models we found to attain higher accuracy 
than any of the classical ML approaches discussed here.
